# EXAMPLE MODULE

This example shows how to create and use custom tags.

All the functions are optional - edit the ones you need, and
delete those that you do not need.

For example, the functions regarding versions, author, support,
etc. are only relevant for modules that you intend to share publicly.

For sub-tags, the codes `0:1`, `1:M`, etc. show the minimum
and maximum number of occurrences.  When setting sub-tags, you
can use `0:0` to remove an existing sub-tag.
